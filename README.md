A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/besimgurpinarr/pen/ZEqeLEO](https://codepen.io/besimgurpinarr/pen/ZEqeLEO).

Random Color Generator
This is a simple web application that generates a random color when the "Generate Color" button is clicked. The color is displayed in a box, and the RGB code for the color is displayed below the box.

Demo
You can see a live demo of the project here.

Technologies Used
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Getting Started
To run this project locally, you can follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine
Open the index.html file in your web browser
Click the "Generate Color" button to generate a new color
How it Works
The color is generated using the Math.random() function in JavaScript to generate random values for the red, green, and blue components of the color. These values are combined to create an RGB color code, which is then applied as the background color of the color box. The RGB code is also displayed below the color box.

Future Improvements
Here are some ideas for future improvements to the project:

Add the ability to generate colors in different color spaces, such as HSL or hex
Allow the user to adjust the brightness or saturation of the generated colors
Add the ability to save and share favorite colors
